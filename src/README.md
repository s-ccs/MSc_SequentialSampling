The included notebook nb contains the development components that were integrated into UnfoldSim.jl. The notebook therefore represents a development status before the implementation was completed and finally improved. 

The final implementation of the UnfoldSim.jl extension can be found under the following pull request and feature branch:
- https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldSim.jl/pull/139
- https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/UnfoldSim.jl/tree/feature-sequentialSamplingModels
